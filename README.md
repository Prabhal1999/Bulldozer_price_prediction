# Bulldozer_price_prediction

Overview
This project involves predicting the auction prices of bulldozers using the Bulldozer Price Prediction dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains historical auction prices of bulldozers, along with various attributes that might influence these prices.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of three main files:

Train.csv: Contains the training data with historical auction prices and features.
Valid.csv: Contains the validation data for model evaluation.
Test.csv: Contains the test data where you need to predict the auction prices.

Objective
The goal is to build a regression model that can predict the sale price of bulldozers at auctions. This involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, exploring different features, and training various regression models to achieve the best performance.

Tools used
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
